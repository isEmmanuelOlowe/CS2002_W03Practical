# W03 Practical

## Overview

The specification required that 2 programs be created in C that calculate the Fibonacci series using an iterative method and a recursive method.

## Design

This practical was developed entirely in windows. It was found that the `scanf` function of `<stdio.h>` was depreciated in windows and the function `scanf_s` was to be used instead.
